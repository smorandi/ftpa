Issues:


comparison with WebKit vs OpenFin vs IR COM Bridge
==================================================

openfin:
- deployment ist a problem and is not under our control (same applies to IE COM Bridge)



x-functionality
===============

-   dialogs are only visible in the webpane -> alternative: show dialog in gui (using popup-callback)
    //somehow useless then to have just a web rendering but interactions handled by the gui


performance
===========
- webkit performance issues with AG-Grid
